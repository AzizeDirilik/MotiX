  <summary><h1>First Sprint 🚀</h1></summary>

## Sprint Notes 📝

In the first sprint, we discussed ideas for the MotiX application and selected the most suitable one. To manage the process more efficiently, we decided to use `Trello` 🗂️ and conducted daily Scrum meetings in writing via `WhatsApp` 💬. Based on the selected idea, tasks were distributed among team members. We prioritized functionality in the design of the pages and decided to use `Firebase` 🔥 in our application.

## Estimated Points for Completion 🎯

`200 points`

## Points Completion Logic 📊

In the first sprint, we focused on meeting the `200-point target` by completing the tasks on time and successfully. Each task contained important components that form the core structure of our application.

## Daily Scrum 📅

Daily Scrum meetings were held in writing via `WhatsApp` 💬. These daily meetings allowed the team to share their daily progress and resolve any potential obstacles.

# Sprint Review 🕵️‍♂️

## Completed Work ✅
- The core concept and name of the application were determined 🧠.
- Design decisions were made, and the development of a minimal and functional user interface began 🎨.
- `Firebase` 🔥 infrastructure was selected, and integration work commenced.
- Prototypes for each screen were created, and the development process started 🛠️.
- A sprint board was created on `Trello` 🗂️, and tasks were managed.
- After user registration and login, onboarding and registration screens were set to not show again 🔄. This allows users to only see these screens the first time and start using the application directly on subsequent logins.

## Next Steps ⏭️

Based on the experience and feedback from the first sprint, we plan to complete core note-taking features and the remaining features of our application in the second sprint. Additionally, we aim to refine design decisions by conducting more detailed reviews of the user interface. We will continue to collaborate and communicate effectively as a team to advance the development of the MotiX application.

## Sprint Retrospective 🔄

<details><summary><h1>Second Sprint</h1></summary></details>

## 🚀 Sprint Notes

On the **first day** of the second sprint, we held a **team meeting**. During this meeting:
- We reviewed the `previous sprint`, shared our experiences, and determined the tasks to focus on for this sprint.
- We agreed on a `general design` for the other pages of the application and assigned tasks.
- We planned to `complete the remaining tasks` from the first sprint and decided to `make changes` to the logo design to enhance the visual integrity and user experience of the application.

## 📊 Estimated Completion Points

`200 points`

## 🔢 Point Completion Logic

Throughout the sprint, each team member will work according to the assigned tasks. The point system is as follows:
- `Points` are assigned based on the complexity and workload of tasks.
- Completing each task earns the `designated points` for that task.
- The `status` of tasks will be evaluated in daily Scrum meetings.
- `Incomplete tasks` will be moved to the backlog of the next sprint and prioritized accordingly.

## 📅 Daily Scrum

We held Daily Scrum meetings via `written communication` on WhatsApp, considering the team members' busy schedules. Each day, every team member shared the following:
- What they `worked on` the previous day,
- What they `plan to work on` today,
- Any `obstacles` they encountered.

This method allowed team members to stay in touch flexibly and quickly share updates.
